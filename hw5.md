title: Sensitivity Analysis
--- 

One strength of this experimental design is that because the MDPs were randomly designed, we do not have to worry about unmeasured confounding.  However, we still have the SUTVA and consistency assumptions that are untestable.

The major assumptions I made were in the groupings I considered for the models.  Since the data is categorical, Model 0 is fully saturated so I have a baseline model that does not assume linearity in any of the parameters.  However, the six other models I evaluated assume that MDPs within each group can be treated interchangeably.  They are also not the only possible groupings, but the number of possible groupings makes testing them all impractical.
