# Outreach
I am one of the founders, coordinators, and volunteer mentors for the Undergraduate Mentoring Program (UMP) in the math department.  We pair small groups of undergrad math majors with two grad student mentors for advice related to the math major and post-graduation plans, and to provide support navigating the challenges of the field.
