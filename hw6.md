title: Conclusion
---

I started a preliminary analysis of the Seqer dataset, to see what characteristics of basic MDPs impact people's ability to solve them for the optimal decisions.  It seems like the relative positioning of the high reward state and the least rewarding state has more of an impact than I expected, but the data is very noisy so I cannot say that with any surety.  I also did not get to analyzing anything past the first MDP. In the future, I would like to try different groupings or parameters of the MDPs. Eventually this will contribute to our understanding of how humans learn and make decisions under uncertainty.
