<p>Office: Van Vleck 416</p>

<p>I am a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amylouisecochran">Dr. Amy Cochran</a> on problems in computational psychiatry and data science, and with <a href="https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/jose/home?authuser=0">Dr. Jose Israel Rodriguez</a> on problems in applied algebra.  I am working towards a PhD in hopes of becoming a statistician or data scientist working with medical practitioners to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Currently I am a Lucidity Data Analyst Project Assistant for the <a href="https://gilmorebykovskyilab.org/">Gilmore-Bykovskyi Lab</a> in Emergency Medicine. I manage, clean, and analyze data sets related to memory changes and dementia in older adults.</p>

<p>Prior to moving to Wisconsin, I graduated from Colorado College in 2020 with a bachelors degree in mathematics.  My time at a liberal arts institution led to an interest in how a cross-disciplinary framing can improve student learning and engagement, especially in introductory courses required by other majors.  My thesis use Markov Chain Monte Carlo for ensemble analysis of congressional voting district maps in Colorado.</p>
