    <div class="home"><h1 class="page-heading">Haley Colgate Kottler</h1><p>I am a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Dr. Amy Cochran on problems in computational psychiatry and data science.  I am working towards a PhD in hopes of becoming a professor.</p>

<p>Prior to moving to Wisconsin, I graduated from Colorado College in 2020 with a bachelors degree in mathematics.  My time at a liberal arts institution led to an interest in how a cross-disciplinary framing can improve student learning and engagement, especially in introductory courses required by other majors.</p>

<p>Currently, I am studying the theory and application of causal inference, as it seems to provide a rigorous method to evaluate whether or not adjustments in teaching methods or psychiatric interventions were effective.</p>
