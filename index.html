I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, working with Dr. Amy Cochran.

I graduated from Colorado College in 2020 with a BA in mathematics.  
My research interests are quantitative justice, interdisciplinary data analysis, and computational psychiatry.  
Outside of research, I enjoy knitting and playing guitar.
